# IAS_ISA_Processor
This Repo has the code for the IAS/Princeton Computer Set. It contains an assembler, a processor and a file where the instructions to be read are given. Currently, it creates the Fibonacci sequence of a number given to it and outputs the sequence modulo 10, along with the number of odd and even numbers in the sequence.
